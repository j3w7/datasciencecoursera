# Run Analysis of Accelerometer Data

The script [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) analyses the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The script was created as part of the requirements for the Coursera Course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-008/).

For more information on the analysis process and result see the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md).
