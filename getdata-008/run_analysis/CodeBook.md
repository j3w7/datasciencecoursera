# CodeBook

This code book describes the variables, the data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data.

## Raw data

The analysis uses the data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" by 

> Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
> Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
> DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, Genoa I-16145, Italy. 

provided in the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

* [Raw data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
* [Raw data description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Transformation details

The data set is transformed using the following steps:

0. Download of the raw data.
1. Merge of the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extraction of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Introduction of descriptive names.
4. Creation of the tidy data set, including averages.

## How to run the analysis

Clone this repository. Load the script into R:

~~~R
source("run_analysis.R")
~~~

Data download and analysis should start automatically. 
The analysis will be performed and the result written to the files tidy_data.tt.

The script was run with R 3.1.1 within RStudio in a Linux environment.

## Result files

* tidy_data.txt contains mean and standard deviation for each measurements from the train and test data |
* average_data.txt contains a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject |

If you want to load those files using R, use the following commands:

~~~R
tidy_data    <- read.table('tidy_data.txt')
~~~
